## Request current and historical USDA-AMS MPR data

### Background    

The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting System (LMPRS) was congressionally mandated by the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 (The Act) and renewed in 2006. The Act requires U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to create a livestock reporting system for up-to-date marketing information on cattle, swine, lambs, and the by-products of such livestock. 

LMPRS requires packers, processors, and importers to report the marketing information several times each day, whereupon it is aggregated and made available electronically to these and other market participants. The marketing information includes pricing, contracting for purchase, and supply and demand conditions for livestock, livestock production, and livestock products. 

Initially, the report data was available at the top of the hour for most reports. Starting on the afternoon of May 4, 2020, LMR will begin releasing report data on LMR Datamart, LMR Web Service and the LMR API in real time. This change brings both voluntary and mandatory report release processes in sync.
